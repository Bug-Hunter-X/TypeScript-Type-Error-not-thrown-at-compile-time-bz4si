This repository contains a demonstration of a subtle bug in TypeScript's type system.  The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers and return a number. However, if a string is passed as an argument, TypeScript does not throw a compile-time error. This allows the code to run, resulting in unexpected behaviour at runtime.  The solution demonstrates how to use stricter type checking to catch this error during compilation.
